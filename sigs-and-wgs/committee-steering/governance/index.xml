      <description>SIG Governance Requirements Goals This document outlines the recommendations and requirements for defining SIG and subproject governance.
This doc uses rfc2119 to indicate keyword requirement levels. Sub elements of a list inherit the requirements of the parent by default unless overridden.
Checklist Following is the checklist of items that should be considered as part of defining governance for any subarea of the Kubernetes project.
Roles  MUST enumerate any roles within the SIG and the responsibilities of each MUST define process for changing the membership of roles  When and how new members are chosen / added to each role When and how existing members are retired from each role  SHOULD define restrictions / requirements for membership of roles MAY define target staffing numbers of roles  Organizational management  MUST define when and how collaboration between members of the SIG is organized</description>
