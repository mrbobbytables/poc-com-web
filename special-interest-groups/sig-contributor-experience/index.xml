      <description>Community Maintenance This document outlines maintenance tasks that SIG Contributor Experience should be doing on a regular basis. Copy this list into a new Github issue, for example &amp;ldquo;Community Maintenance Tasks for 2Q 2018&amp;rdquo;. Then people can volunteer to audit different parts of the project at once. These tasks should be done at a minimum of twice a year, but ideally once a quarter.
If any of these tasks can be automated, then do so, however most of these require a human to make a judgement decision.</description>

      <description>Markdown Link Style Guide Markdown provides for a number of different ways to link between documents. There are advantages and disadvantages of each method.
 If you are linking between documents in the same folder, the easiest way to do it is use a relative link.
See this other document [here](document-2).  If you are linking to a file in the same repo, but not in the same directory, it&amp;rsquo;s usually best to use an absolute link from the root of the repo.</description>
